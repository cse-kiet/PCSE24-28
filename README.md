# Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning
This project presents a comprehensive "Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine 
Learning in Python." The primary focus is on predicting three significant diseases: Diabetes, 
Heart Disease, and Parkinson's, employing advanced machine learning models. The core 
objective is to develop an intuitive web application that enables individuals to assess their risk 
for these diseases efficiently. 
The project entails meticulous exploration of relevant datasets, detailing their sources and key 
features. Machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines for Diabetes and 
Parkinson's predictions, as well as Logistic Regression for Heart Disease, are employed. The 
training and evaluation processes are discussed, showcasing the effectiveness of the models in 
terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
